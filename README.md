# tic-tac-toe-with-ai
An implementation based on minimax algorithm . #jetbrainsacademy #freeCodeCamp

This is a solution for the project Tic-Tac-Toe with AI from JetBrains Academy - https://hyperskill.org/projects/81

It can be started using the command "start" followed by two arguments: user, easy, medium, hard, e.g start user hard
  user stands for human player;
  easy, medium and hard stands for machine player:
    easy - the program moves randomly to a free position on the board;
    medium - the program moves randomly to a free position on the board but taking into account one move ahead to see an immediate win or prevent an immediate loss;
    hard - the program is unbeatable by using the minimax algorithm as is described here https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37/
